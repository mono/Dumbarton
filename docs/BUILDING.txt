To build Dumbarton from source, you will need:

XCode 2.2.1, with the 10.4 Universal SDK installed
Mono.framework installed.

The Dumbarton project should compile out of the box with one change;
you must set the "Place Build Products" path of the Dumbarton project
and the internal Judy project to the same path. This setting cannot be
distributed with Dumbarton because it is saved in a user-specific settings
file.
