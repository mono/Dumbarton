Dumbarton is a general purpose library.  It is geared
towards software developers who write for Mac OS X.
Dumbarton enables Objective C code to run and
exchange data efficiently with C# code.  In particular
it enables native Cocoa UI's to be written in
Objective C for software written in C# and using
the open source Mono runtime.  Dumbarton was
architected by Bryan Berg and Allan Hsu in the Summer
of 2005 for precisely this purpose.  Allan fleshed
out the design and optimized it so it could be used
in real world applications.

This is our very first prerelease of the Dumbarton
code.  It comes without documentation, sample code,
or even a makefile.  We plan to make all of these
available as soon as we can write them.  However,
this code is fully functional and is part of our
imeem for Mac software.  Dumbarton comes bundled
with the Judy library (also LGPL), and available
separately at:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/judy

We would not be where we are today as a company and
as individuals without open source software, and it
is our goal to contribute back to the community where
we can.  Contact us with questions, bug reports and
patches at support@imeem.com and we will do our best
to address them quickly.
